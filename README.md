# Game Of Drones

This project is my first experience with the MEAN stack. It has been developed with the aim of evaluating my technical skills in web development. I built it in exactly one week, from courses, tutorials and online documentation.

The persistence of information in the database has not yet been fully implemented, so data is lost if the server is turned off.

The project is made to be executed in a development environment and has dependencies that are already specified in its configuration file. These dependencies are necessary for the execution of the application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Requirements

Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Start

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The server runs on port 3000.

Running the `npm start` command concurrently executes the client and server services.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
